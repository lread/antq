[NOTE]
====
Antq requires Clojure 1.10.0 or later. +
Basically, antq could work regardless of the Clojure version which your project depends. +
If you have a trouble, please see link:./doc/non-supported-clojure-version.adoc[here].

== Usage

[[cli-usage]]
=== Clojure CLI (deps.edn)

Run the following command for trial.
[source,sh]
----
clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.liquidz/antq {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -M -m antq.core
----

Or add the following alias to your `$HOME/.clojure/deps.edn`.
[source,clojure]
----
{
 :aliases
 {:outdated {;; Note that it is `:deps`, not `:extra-deps`
             :deps {com.github.liquidz/antq {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
             :main-opts ["-m" "antq.core"]}}
 }
----
Then, run `clojure -M:outdated`.
(run `clojure -A:outdated` for Clojure CLI Tool 1.10.1.645 or earlier).

[[cli-tool-usage]]
=== Clojure CLI Tools (`1.11.1.1139` or later)

From Clojure CLI ver `1.11.1.1139`, https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#tool_install[tool] installation is supported.

[source,sh]
----
# Install tool
clojure -Ttools install-latest :lib com.github.liquidz/antq :as antq
# Uninstall tool
clojure -Ttools remove :tool antq
# Update tool
clojure -Ttools install-latest :tool antq

# Execute
clojure -Tantq outdated
# Execute with parameter
clojure -Tantq outdated :upgrade true
# Show help
clojure -A:deps -Tantq help/doc
# Upgrade oudated dependencies
clojure -Tantq outdated :check-clojure-tools true :upgrade true
----

=== Leiningen (as a `main` program)

Add the following dependency and alias to your `$HOME/.lein/profiles.clj`.
[source,clojure]
----
{
 :user
 {:aliases {"outdated" ["with-profile" "antq" "run" "-m" "antq.core"]}}
 :antq
 {:dependencies [[com.github.liquidz/antq "RELEASE"]]}
 }
----
Then, run `lein outdated`.

[[lein-plugin-usage]]
=== Leiningen (as a plugin)

When using antq as a leiningen plugin, it will also include lein-loaded `project.clj` dependencies.
Only antq loaded `project.clj` dependencies are upgradeable by antq.

Add the following plugin to your `project.clj` (or `$HOME/.lein/profiles.clj`):
[source,clojure]
----
 :plugins [[com.github.liquidz/antq "RELEASE"]]
 ;; optional - you can add antq options here:
 :antq {}
----
Then, run `lein antq`.

<<Command line options, options>> take precedent over `:antq` options.

=== GitHub Actions

Antq can work with https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions].
See antq's workflow for concrete example.

* https://github.com/liquidz/antq/blob/master/.github/workflows/dependencies.yml[.github/workflows/dependencies.yml]
* To show errors as annotations, please set this option: `--error-format="::error file={{file}}::{{message}}"`

In another way, you can use the following action.

* https://github.com/liquidz/antq-action

=== Gradle

Antq experimentally supports https://gradle.org[Gradle].
See link:./doc/gradle.adoc[here] for details.

=== Timeouts

Antq has timeouts for acquiring various information.
See link:./doc/timeout.adoc[here] for details.

[[options]]
== Options

Sections below describe <<cli-usage,clojure cli usage>>.
For <<cli-tool-usage, cli tool usage>> and `:antq` options for <<lein-plugin-usage, lein plugin usage>>, options are expressed as keywords.

For examples:

* `--upgrade` is expressed `:upgrade true` for both the cli tool usage and lein `antq` option usage.
* `--exclude=artifact1 --exclude artifact2@version` is expressed as:
** `:exclude '["artifact1" "artifact2@version"]'` as cli tool usage option
** `:exclude ["artifact1" "artifact2@version"]` as a lein plugin `:antq` option

=== --upgrade
Upgrade outdated versions interactively.
You can use `--force` option for upgrading without confirmation, and `--download` option for downloading upgraded dependencies on the fly.

[WARNING]
====
For now, `--upgrade` option only supports following files:

* `deps.edn`
* `shadow-cljs.edn`
* `project.clj`
* `build.boot`
* `pom.xml`
====

=== --exclude=ARTIFACT_NAME[@VERSION]
Skip version checking for specified artifacts or versions.

E.g.
[source,sh]
----
# Exclude all versions of specified artifact
--exclude=com.github.liquidz/antq
# Exclude specific version of specified artifact
--exclude=com.github.liquidz/antq@0.13.0
# Exclude version range of specified artifact
--exclude=com.github.liquidz/antq@0.13.x
----

When you specified a version number, antq will report the latest version excluding only the specified version.

You could also specify dependencies to exclude with `:antq/exclude` metadata.
See link:./doc/exclusions.adoc[Exclusions] for more information.

NOTE: You must specify `groupId/artifactId` for Java dependencies.

=== --directory=DIRECTORY
Add search path for projects.
Current directory(`.`) is added by default.

E.g. `-d foo --directory=bar:baz` will search "foo", "baz" and "bar" directories.

=== --focus=ARTIFACT_NAME

Focus version checking for specified artifacts.

E.g. `--focus=com.github.liquidz/antq`

NOTE: You must specify `groupId/artifactId` for Java dependencies.

WARNING: `focus` option is prefer than `exclude` option.

If you want to focus the upgrade on specific version of dependency, you can use `--focus=ARTIFACT_NAME[@VERSION]`.

E.g. `--focus=com.github.liquidz/antq@50.2.0`

Will set antq dep to version 50.2.0, even if that version doesn't exist.

=== --skip=PROJECT_TYPE
Skip to search specified project files.
Must be one of `boot`, `clojure-cli`, `github-action`, `pom`, `shadow-cljs` and `leiningen`.

E.g. `--skip=pom`

=== --error-format=ERROR_FORMAT
Customize outputs for outdated dependencies.

E.g.  `--error-format="::error file={{file}}::{{message}}"`

You can use following variables:

[cols="50,50a"]
|===
| Variable Name | Description

| `{{file}}`
| A filename containing outdated dependencies.

| `{{name}}`
| The artifact name.

| `{{version}}`
| The current version.

| `{{latest-version}}`
| The latest version.

| `{{latest-name}}`
| The latest artifact name.
See details: https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Verified-Group-Names[Clojars Verified Group Names policy].

| `{{changes-url}}`
| The changes URL in Version Control System. (Nullable)

| `{{diff-url}}`
| WARNING: DEPRECATED.
Please use `changes-url` instead.

The diff URL for Version Control System. (Nullable)


| `{{message}}`
| Default error message.

|===

Antq uses https://github.com/athos/pogonos[Pogonos] as a template engine, so you can use http://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] features.

e.g. `{{name}}{{#latest-name}} -> {{.}}{{/latest-name}}`

=== --reporter=REPORTER

|===
| Reporter Name | Description

| `table` (default)
| Report results in a table.

| `format`
| Report results with a custom format.
When you use `--error-format` option, this reporter will be used automatically.

| `json`
| Report results as a JSON format.

| `edn`
| Report results as a EDN format.

|===

=== --download
If `download` is set and updated dependencies are found,
download them at the same time as a convenience. The default action
is not to download anything.

[WARNING]
====
antq only downloads **upgraded** dependencies by `--upgrade` option.

If you upgrade manually or without the `--download` option and the version is changed to the latest,
the new version will not be downloaded even if you specify the `--download` option later (because antq does not detect differences).
====

=== --ignore-locals

For java dependencies, ignore versions installed to your local Maven repository(`~/.m2/`)

=== --check-clojure-tools

Detect all tools installed in `~/.clojure/tools` as dependencies.
You can also upgrade them with `--upgrade` option.

=== --no-changes

Skip checking changes between deps' versions. Disabled by default.

=== --no-diff

WARNING: DEPRECATED.
Please use `--no-changes` instead.

Skip checking diff between deps' versions. Disabled by default.

=== --changes-in-table

Show changes URLs in table.
This option is only available for `table` reporter.
Disabed by default.

=== --transitive

Scan outdated transitive dependencies. Disabled by default.

[NOTE]
=====
The default scan depth is `5`, but it is customizable by the environmental variable `ANTQ_TRANSITIVE_MAX_DEPTH`.
=====

[WARNING]
====
With this option, the number of reported dependencies tends to be very large, so it is recommended to use it with the `--no-changes` option.
Otherwise, it may take a long time for the results to be reported.
